# 🌍 KUSAIDIA: Revolutionizing Aid Distribution in Africa 🚀

Welcome to **KUSAIDIA**! We're a blockchain-based platform transforming how aid reaches those who need it most in Africa. 🌟 Inspired by real-world challenges like the 2014-2016 Ebola crisis, where up to 30% of aid funds were lost to inefficiencies, we’re here to make aid distribution **transparent**, **efficient**, and **impactful**. 💪
